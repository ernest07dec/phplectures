<?php 
/* --- Object Oriented Programming -- */

/*
  From PHP5 onwards you can write PHP in either a procedural or object oriented way. OOP consists of classes that can hold "properties" and "methods". Objects can be created from classes.
*/


// Access Modifiers: public, private, protected
// public - can be accessed from anywhere
// private - can only be accessed from inside the class
// protected - can only be accessed from inside the class and by inheriting classes


// The constructor is called whenever an object is created from the class.
// We pass in properties to the constructor from the outside.
// We assign the properties passed in from the outside to the properties we created inside the class.


// Methods are functions that belong to a class.

// Destructor is called when an object is destroyed or the end of the script.

/* ----------- Inheritence ---------- */

/*
  Inheritence is the ability to create a new class from an existing class.
  It is achieved by creating a new class that extends an existing class.
